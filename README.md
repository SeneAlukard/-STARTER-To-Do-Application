2. Run the application: `./todoapp`

## Progress and Learning
- This project was developed as part of my journey in learning C and C++.
- Key concepts practiced include class creation, vector handling, basic input/output, and control structures in C++.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the interface for a more user-friendly experience. After i learn how to properly use GUI
- Implement file handling to save and retrieve tasks.
- Expand functionality with more detailed task descriptions and categories.
